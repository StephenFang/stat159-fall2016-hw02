## Description
`report.Rmd` is the source Rmd document used to generate the pdf report.
It reads in the objects of `regression.RData`, produces the tables, and 
includes the image in `scatterplot-tv-sales.png`.

`report.pdf` is the generated pdf file from the Rmd document. 
Alternatively you could have a `report.html` file. Or even better,
you can try to have both types of output: pdf and html. It is not mandatory
to have both types of files.
